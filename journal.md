Date: 1.16.25 - Subject: Starting Out. Here I start a journal where I will be going over what I did and learned this semester. 
It's going to be great!


Date: 1.17.25 - Subject: Discrete Math. Alright, so I have been working on my discrete mathematics homework today trying to figure Out
combinations and permutations. It's easy so far, because after all, I did use both of these a ton when I was in Probability and Statistics.
However, Professor Stander has stated that next time we meet in class, we will go over permutations and combinations that allow for repeats to
happen, which he mentioned would be a lot harder. I can't remember if we used combinations and permutations where repeats were allowed in
stats, but hopefully it comes to me fast. Maybe when we start on the topic it will occur to me wether or not I have used it before.

Date: 1.21.25 - Subject: Ideas. Today during class we came up with some ideas for a project that we are going to do throughout the semester.
We each gave an idea based on a "What if..." question, and then organized those ideas into Categories based on if it was a feature or an app idea. We then choose one idea for an app and 5-8 ideas for features. We are going to be doing a Music Social Media app, but have agreed that we will expand it to other things as soon as we get the music portion of it done. We want it to be highly secured, and so we plan on adding lots of design that have to do with encryption and what not. We also want it to stand out from other social media platforms, and we decided the way we are going to do this is through personalization. Users will be able to personalize their feed, page, and tab bar to fit their very needs and what they want to do with it. This is some of the things that we agreed to do in class.
