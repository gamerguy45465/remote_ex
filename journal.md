Date: 1.16.25 - Subject: Starting Out. Here I start a journal where I will be going over what I did and learned this semester. 
It's going to be great!


Date: 1.17.25 - Subject: Discrete Math. Alright, so I have been working on my discrete mathematics homework today trying to figure Out
combinations and permutations. It's easy so far, because after all, I did use both of these a ton when I was in Probability and Statistics.
However, Professor Stander has stated that next time we meet in class, we will go over permutations and combinations that allow for repeats to
happen, which he mentioned would be a lot harder. I can't remember if we used combinations and permutations where repeats were allowed in
stats, but hopefully it comes to me fast. Maybe when we start on the topic it will occur to me wether or not I have used it before.
